# Color Game

## Overview
The Color Game is a simple, interactive frontend project designed to test and improve users' color recognition skills. The game randomly generates a target color, and the player must guess the correct color from six options. Built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**, this project is an excellent way to practice DOM manipulation and event handling.

## Features
1. **Random Color Generation**: The target color and options are dynamically generated.
2. **Interactive Gameplay**: Users click on color buttons to guess the target color.
3. **Score Tracking**: The game maintains a score counter that increments for each correct guess.
4. **Game Reset**: A "New Game" button resets the game with a fresh target color and options.
5. **User Feedback**: The game provides immediate feedback on whether the guess is correct or not.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structure of the game.
- **CSS**: Styling for the game interface.
- **JavaScript**: Logic for random color generation, event handling, and dynamic updates.
